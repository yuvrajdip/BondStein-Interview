The dashboard displays data charts which are fetched from a REST API. It means GET or READ operation is done perfectly. So, to troubleshoot and resolve the issue of charts are not updating in real-time as new data arrives from the API in a ReactJS and Tailwind CSS dashboard , we can follow some steps : 

- Check API Response Format

- Confirm that the data is actually changing

- Make sure that the react states are updating correctly otherwise UI will not change

- Use state management to ensure that the states are updated correctly ( If applicable)

- Check for Errors by monitoring the browser console

- Check the code for Update operation both at backend and frontend

- It may also happen for Database error. May be the database is not updated correctly in the database
